This subdirectory contains jupyter notebooks with the python code for the analysis.
Many of the functions used are from a seperate github repository under the name "ExcessMortality", developed by the same authors, but kept seperately.

Data-collections for specified geographical regions (counties/"amt") were generated based on original raw data, not available to the public. 
This repository however contains all parts of the analysis, starting with the data-collections available in the "Data" subdirectory. 

The order of notebooks for the analysis is:
* ~~AnalyseAllCountiesForPeriods~~ AnalyzeExcessMortality
* ~~CollectPeriodOfExcess~~ CollectMortalityCrises
* ~~ClusteringOfResults~~ Clustering
* ~~DetermineGroupsManually~~ DetermineGroups
* PlotSpecificPeriodsOfExcess
